# IoT Home Automation System

A comprehensive smart home solution that connects and controls various IoT devices through a centralized system with mobile app control and intelligent automation.

## Smart Features

### üè† Device Control

- Smart lighting with dimming and scheduling
- Climate control and thermostat management
- Security camera monitoring and alerts
- Smart door locks and access control

### üì± Mobile Application

- Real-time device status monitoring
- Remote control from anywhere
- Custom automation rule creation
- Energy usage tracking and optimization

## IoT Architecture

### üîå Hardware Integration

- Arduino-based sensor nodes
- Raspberry Pi central hub
- WiFi and Zigbee connectivity
- Voice control integration (Alexa, Google)

### üìä Data Analytics

- Energy consumption monitoring
- Usage pattern analysis
- Predictive maintenance alerts
- Cost optimization recommendations

## System Implementation

The system uses MQTT for device communication and time-series database for sensor data:

```python
# IoT device manager
class DeviceManager:
    def __init__(self, mqtt_broker: str):
        self.mqtt_client = mqtt.Client()
        self.devices = {}

    def register_device(self, device_id: str, device_type: str):
        topic = f"home/{device_type}/{device_id}"
        self.mqtt_client.subscribe(f"{topic}/status")
        self.devices[device_id] = Device(device_id, device_type, topic)

    def send_command(self, device_id: str, command: str, value: Any):
        device = self.devices[device_id]
        self.mqtt_client.publish(f"{device.topic}/command", {
            "command": command,
            "value": value,
            "timestamp": time.time()
        })
```

Features include automated scheduling, energy optimization, and integration with popular smart home ecosystems.
